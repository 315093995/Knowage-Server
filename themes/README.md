This project contains themes available out-of-the-box for Knowage. We'll refer to that folder where Knowage is as KNOWAGE_SERVER_HOME.

To use one of these themes, you can simply paste the subfolder <name_of_the_theme> (e.g. Knowage-Server/themes/FIWARE) into KNOWAGE_SERVER_HOME\webapps\knowage\themes.
